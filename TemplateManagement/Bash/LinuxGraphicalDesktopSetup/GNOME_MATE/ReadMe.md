# Introduction

These scripts install GNOME\Xrdp and MATE\X2Go graphical desktop environments on Ubuntu.  The scripts provide different configuration steps depending on the version, graphical desktop environment, and remote desktop server technology being used:
- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS to install GNOME\Xrdp and MATE\X2Go.
- Ubuntu 20.04/21.04/22.04 LTS to install GNOME\Xrdp.
- Ubuntu 20.04/22.04 LTS to install MATE\X2Go.

> [!NOTE]
> The Ubuntu 18.04 and 21.04 LTS images are *no* longer available in the Azure marketplace as a free image provided by Canonical.  Azure Labs only supports using free marketplace images. The instructions provided for Ubuntu 18.04/21.04 LTS are only applicable to custom lab images that were previously [saved to a Compute Gallery](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/lab-services/approaches-for-custom-image-creation#save-a-custom-image-from-a-lab-template-virtual-machine), or to custom images that are imported from a [physical lab environment](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/lab-services/approaches-for-custom-image-creation#bring-a-custom-image-from-a-vhd-in-your-physical-lab-environment).  Otherwise, we recommend using Ubuntu 20.04 or 22.04 LTS which are available as free marketplace images.

If you are using a custom image with Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, the GNOME and MATE graphical desktop environments have a networking conflict with the Azure Linux Agent which is needed for the VMs to work properly in Azure Labs.  For example, this networking conflict will cause lab creation to fail when attempting to provision the template VM.  Likewise, it will cause publish to hang when attempting to provision the student VMs.  To successfully use use GNOME or MATE on lab VMs, the below scripts include additional steps that are required to fix this networking conflict with Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.  This issue is being tracked by the following Canonical bug:  <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cloud-init/+bug/1832381>.

Ubuntu 20.04/22.04 LTS do *not* have this networking conflict with the Azure Linux Agent when you install GNOME or MATE.  As a result, when you run the below scripts to install 20.04/22.04, the steps for fixing the networking conflict are skipped.

## Ubuntu

These scripts have been tested with:

- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS to install GNOME\Xrdp and MATE\X2Go.
- Ubuntu 20.04/21.04/22.04 LTS to install GNOME\Xrdp.
- Ubuntu 20.04/22.04 LTS to install MATE\X2Go.

> [!NOTE]
> X2Go isn't compatible with GNOME which is why Xrdp must be used.  See X2Go's list of [compatible desktop environments](https://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php/doc:de-compat) for more information.

## Configuring X2Go and Xrdp

Both [X2Go](https://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php/doc:newtox2go) and [Xrdp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xrdp) are Remote Desktop solutions, which sometimes is referred to as Remote Control.  A key difference between X2Go is that it uses the same port as SSH (port 22).  Azure Labs enables the SSH port by default. Xrdp uses port 3389 which [you must enable](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/lab-services/how-to-enable-remote-desktop-linux#enable-remote-desktop-connection-for-rdp) when you create a lab.

X2Go typically provides better performance for students when they need to connect to a Linux VM.  However, X2Go doesn't support all graphical desktops.  As a result, these instructions show using X2Go with MATE and Xrdp with GNOME.  The script also makes performance optimizations for GNOME because it is a more resource intensive desktop environment.

There are two steps involved to set up either X2Go or Xrdp: *(Students only need to do step #2 below to connect to their assigned VM)*

1. [Install the X2Go\Xrdp server](#install-x2go-or-xrdp-server) on the lab's template VM using one of the scripts below.
2. [Install X2Go\RDP client and create a session](#install-x2go-or-rdp-client-and-create-a-session) to connect to your lab (remote) VM.

### Install X2Go or Xrdp Server

The lab (remote) VM runs either the X2Go or Xrdp server. Graphical sessions are started on this remote VM and the server transfers the windows/desktops graphics to the client.

The scripts below automatically install the X2Go\Xrdp server and the MATE\GNOME graphical desktop environment.  To install using these scripts, SSH into the template VM and paste in one of the following scripts depending on which desktop environment you prefer:

#### Install MATE Desktop and X2Go Server

```bash
sudo sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/LabServices/main/TemplateManagement/Bash/LinuxGraphicalDesktopSetup/GNOME_MATE/Ubuntu/x2go-mate.sh)"
```

#### Install GNOME Desktop And Xrdp Server

```bash
sudo sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/LabServices/main/TemplateManagement/Bash/LinuxGraphicalDesktopSetup/GNOME_MATE/Ubuntu/xrdp-gnome.sh)"
```

### Install X2Go or RDP Client and Create a Session

Once you have the X2Go\Xrdp server installed on your template VM (using the scripts above), you'll use the X2Go\RDP client to remotely connect to the VM. The X2Go\RDP Client is the application that allows you to connect to a remote server and display a graphical desktop on your local machine.
